**User:**

I am working on building a version of Tetris with Phaser 3. I want the game to include:

1. A splash screen featuring the game's title.
2. A menu scene where the player can click a start button. This scene will display the text "TETRIS" and possibly include a background image.
3. A game scene, which will display a block at the top for "LINES - 000" just above the game board. The game board should have a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares. To the left of the board, there should be three stacked boxes. Starting from the bottom, the first box will display "LEVEL" along with the current level number. Above that, a "NEXT" box will show the next piece and its orientation. At the top, there is another box divided into four rows. The first two rows are for "TOP" and will display the top score. Below that, "SCORE" will display the current score, supporting up to six digits.

Let's outline the structure of the project and how to organize the code for the game. After that, we can begin building the game scene by scene using the Phaser 3 JavaScript library.

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's break down the project structure and organize the code for your Tetris game using Phaser 3. Here's a suggested project structure:

```
tetris-game/
│
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── background.png
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── fonts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── audio/
│       └── ...
│
├── src/
│   ├── scenes/
│   │   ├── SplashScene.js
│   │   ├── MenuScene.js
│   │   └── GameScene.js
│   ├── config.js
│   └── game.js
│
└── index.html
```

Here's a breakdown of the project structure:

- The `assets` folder contains all the game assets, such as images, fonts, and audio files.
- The `src` folder contains the JavaScript source code for the game.
  - The `scenes` folder contains separate files for each game scene (Splash, Menu, Game).
  - `config.js` holds the game configuration, such as screen dimensions and other settings.
  - `game.js` is the main entry point of the game where you create the Phaser game instance and add the scenes.
- `index.html` is the HTML file that loads the game.

Now, let's start building the game scene by scene:

1. Splash Scene:
   - Create a new file `SplashScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - In this scene, display the game's title and any necessary splash screen graphics.
   - After a certain duration or user interaction, transition to the Menu Scene.

2. Menu Scene:
   - Create a new file `MenuScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - Display the text "TETRIS" and optionally add a background image.
   - Add a start button that, when clicked, transitions to the Game Scene.

3. Game Scene:
   - Create a new file `GameScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - Set up the game board with a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares.
   - Display the "LINES - 000" block at the top above the game board.
   - Create three stacked boxes to the left of the board:
     - Bottom box: Display "LEVEL" and the current level number.
     - Middle box: Display "NEXT" and show the next piece and its orientation.
     - Top box: Divide into four rows. The first two rows are for "TOP" and display the top score. The bottom two rows are for "SCORE" and display the current score (up to six digits).

To organize the code for each scene, you can use Phaser's scene lifecycle methods:

- `preload()`: Load assets required for the scene.
- `create()`: Set up the scene, create game objects, and initialize variables.
- `update()`: Update the scene every frame, handle game logic and input.

In the `game.js` file, create the Phaser game instance and add the scenes in the desired order.

```javascript
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';
import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene.js';
import GameScene from './scenes/GameScene.js';

const config = {
  // ... game configuration
  scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene, GameScene]
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

This outline should give you a good starting point for structuring your Tetris game using Phaser 3. You can now start implementing each scene and adding the necessary game logic and graphics.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to provide more detailed guidance on any specific part of the game!

**User:**

Thank you! This plan is very helpful. I've created the file structure and added empty files, including favicon32x32.png, favicon16x16.png, and the background image for the splash scene, splashSceneBackground.png (1024x1024). I want to continue by completing index.html and integrating the game to ensure this part is working and visible before proceeding with the implementation of the scenes.

**Assistant:**

Excellent! Let's proceed with completing the `index.html` file and integrating the game to ensure it's working and visible before diving into the implementation of the scenes.

Here's an example of how your `index.html` file could look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tetris Game</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/images/favicon32x32.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="assets/images/favicon16x16.png">
  <style>
    body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      background-color: #000;
    }
    canvas {
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="game-container"></div>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="src/game.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this `index.html` file:

- We set the document title to "Tetris Game".
- We add the favicon links for different sizes (32x32 and 16x16) in the `<head>` section.
- We include a simple CSS style to remove the default margin and padding from the `body`, set the background color to black, and center the game canvas horizontally.
- We create a `<div>` element with the id "game-container" where the game canvas will be inserted.
- We include the Phaser library from a CDN (you can also download and host it locally if preferred).
- Finally, we include the `game.js` file as a module using the `type="module"` attribute.

Now, let's update the `game.js` file to create the Phaser game instance and load the splash scene background:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';

const gameConfig = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: config.width,
  height: config.height,
  parent: 'game-container',
  scene: [SplashScene],
};

new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
```

In the `game.js` file:

- We import the `config` object from a separate `config.js` file (which we'll create next) to set the game's width and height.
- We import the `SplashScene` from the `SplashScene.js` file.
- We create a `gameConfig` object with the necessary configuration properties, including the game dimensions, the parent element (the "game-container" div), and the initial scene (SplashScene).
- Finally, we create a new instance of the Phaser game using the `gameConfig`.

Create a new file `config.js` in the `src` folder with the following content:

```javascript
// config.js
export default {
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  // ... other game configurations
};
```

This `config.js` file exports an object with the game's width and height. You can adjust these values according to your desired game dimensions.

With these files in place, you should now see the game canvas with the splash scene background image when you open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Next, we'll start implementing the `SplashScene` to display the game title and handle the transition to the `MenuScene`.

**User:**

Thank you! I applied all the changes. I also changed the CDN to point to phaser@v3.80.1 instead of phaser@3.55.2 because this is the newest version. I added the following link tag: `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="64x64" href="assets/images/favicon64x64.png">`. Let's continue with implementing the SplashScene and adding the assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png image. I am attaching the splashSceneBackground.png image to have ideas on how it looks.
![splashSceneBackground image](assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png)

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's implement the `SplashScene` and add the `splashSceneBackground.png` image to the game.

First, make sure the `splashSceneBackground.png` image is placed in the `assets/images` folder.

Now, open the `SplashScene.js` file in the `src/scenes` folder and add the following code:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('splashBackground', 'assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    this.add.image(0, 0, 'splashBackground').setOrigin(0);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    this.time.delayedCall(2000, () => {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the `SplashScene`:

- We define a constructor and call `super('SplashScene')` to set the scene key.

- In the `preload` method, we load the `splashSceneBackground.png` image using `this.load.image()` and assign it a key of `'splashBackground'`.

- In the `create` method:
  - We add the splash background image to the scene using `this.add.image()`, positioning it at (0, 0) and setting its origin to the top-left corner.
  - We add the "TETRIS" title text using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center of the screen using `this.cameras.main.centerX` and `this.cameras.main.centerY`. We set the font size to 128 pixels and the fill color to white.
  - We use `this.time.delayedCall()` to wait for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) before starting the `'MenuScene'` using `this.scene.start('MenuScene')`.

Make sure to import the `SplashScene` in the `game.js` file:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';

// ... rest of the game configuration and initialization code
```

With these changes, when you run the game, you should see the splash screen with the background image and the "TETRIS" title text. After 2 seconds, the game will automatically transition to the `MenuScene` (which we'll implement next).

The provided `splashSceneBackground.png` image looks great and fits well with the game's theme. The blue grid pattern and the "TETRIS" logo in the center create a visually appealing splash screen.

Next, let's move on to implementing the `MenuScene` where the player can click a start button to begin the game.

**User:**

The image already contains the text "TETRIS", so we don't need to add any extra text. Also, the screen size is 800x600, but the image is 1024x1024. We can resize it to fit better in the frame, as there is some extra space on the sides anyway. Could you upscale it to adjust appropriately? I also adjusted the `this.time.delayedCall` to be after 3s instead of 2s. What is the difference between using `this.time.delayedCall` and using the `update` method in combination with a check that the time is >3000, for example, to handle the transition to the `MenuScene`?

**Assistant:**

Apologies for the confusion. Since the splash background image already contains the "TETRIS" text, we don't need to add it separately. Let's update the `SplashScene` to resize the background image to fit the screen size of 800x600 and adjust the delay to 3 seconds.

Here's the updated `SplashScene.js` code:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('splashBackground', 'assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'splashBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    this.time.delayedCall(3000, () => {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the updated code:

- We create the background image using `this.add.image()` and store it in the `backgroundImage` variable.
- We calculate the scale factors `scaleX` and `scaleY` by dividing the screen width and height by the background image's width and height, respectively.
- We set the scale of the background image using `backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY)` to make it fit the screen size.
- We adjust the delay to 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) in `this.time.delayedCall()`.

Regarding the difference between using `this.time.delayedCall()` and using the `update()` method with a time check:

- `this.time.delayedCall()` is a built-in Phaser method that allows you to execute a callback function after a specified delay. It is a convenient way to handle delayed actions without the need for manual time tracking. The delayed call is automatically managed by Phaser's time system.

- Using the `update()` method with a time check involves manually tracking the elapsed time and checking if it exceeds a certain threshold. You would need to store the start time and compare it with the current time in each frame update. This approach gives you more control over the timing logic but requires additional code to manage the time tracking.

Here's an example of how you could use the `update()` method with a time check:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
    this.startTime = 0;
  }

  // ... preload() and create() methods ...

  update(time) {
    if (time - this.startTime > 3000) {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    }
  }

  create() {
    // ... background image setup ...
    this.startTime = this.time.now;
  }
}
```

In this approach, we store the start time in the `startTime` property when the scene is created. In the `update()` method, we compare the current time (`time`) with the start time and check if the difference exceeds 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). If the condition is met, we start the `MenuScene`.

Both approaches achieve the same result, but using `this.time.delayedCall()` is generally more straightforward and recommended for simple delayed actions.

Let me know if you have any further questions!

**User:**

I decided to use this.time.delayedCall and I applied all the changes. Everything worked perfectly, thank you! Let's continue with implementing the menu page. I would like to have a large text block at the top with "TETRIS" and, more towards the center, a button labeled "START" which, when clicked, transitions the user to the GameScene. For the background, I have the assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png image that is 1024x1024. The main colors are different shades of dark gray and black.

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's implement the menu scene with the "TETRIS" text block at the top, a "START" button in the center, and the `menuSceneBackground.png` image as the background.

First, make sure the `menuSceneBackground.png` image is placed in the `assets/images` folder.

Now, create a new file called `MenuScene.js` in the `src/scenes` folder and add the following code:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.rectangle(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      200,
      80,
      0xffffff
    );
    startButton.setInteractive();

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#000000',
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the `MenuScene`:

- We load the `menuSceneBackground.png` image in the `preload()` method using `this.load.image()` and assign it a key of `'menuBackground'`.

- In the `create()` method:
  - We add the background image and scale it to fit the screen size, similar to how we did it in the `SplashScene`.
  - We add the "TETRIS" title text using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center horizontally and 150 pixels from the top. We set the font size to 128 pixels and the fill color to white.
  - We create a "START" button using `this.add.rectangle()`, positioning it at the center of the screen. We set its width to 200 pixels, height to 80 pixels, and fill color to white.
  - We make the button interactive using `startButton.setInteractive()`, allowing it to respond to input events.
  - We add the "START" text on top of the button using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center of the button. We set the font size to 48 pixels and the fill color to black.
  - We add a `pointerdown` event listener to the button using `startButton.on('pointerdown', ...)`. When the button is clicked, we start the `GameScene` using `this.scene.start('GameScene')`.

Make sure to import the `MenuScene` in the `game.js` file and add it to the scene array:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';
import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene.js';

const gameConfig = {
  // ... game configuration ...
  scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene],
};

new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
```

With these changes, after the splash screen, the game will transition to the menu scene, where you will see the "TETRIS" text block at the top and a "START" button in the center. Clicking the "START" button will start the `GameScene` (which we'll implement next).

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

Thank you! It works, but I would like to make a few changes to MenuScene.js:
1) I want the text at the top to be brown.
2) I want the start button to be a rounded button with a red color and the text to be white.
Please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js.

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's the updated `MenuScene.js` with the changes you requested:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#a52a2a', // Brown color
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xff0000, 1); // Red color
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff', // White color
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The color of the "TETRIS" text at the top is changed to brown. We use the hexadecimal color code `'#a52a2a'` to represent the brown color.

2. The start button is now created using `this.add.graphics()` instead of `this.add.rectangle()`. We set the fill color to red using `startButton.fillStyle(0xff0000, 1)`. The button is drawn as a rounded rectangle using `startButton.fillRoundedRect()`, with a width of 200 pixels, a height of 80 pixels, and a corner radius of 40 pixels. The button is positioned at the center of the screen.

   To make the rounded button interactive, we use `startButton.setInteractive()` and pass a `Phaser.Geom.Rectangle` object that defines the interactive area of the button. The rectangle is positioned at the same coordinates as the button and has the same dimensions.

   The text color of the "START" text on the button is changed to white using the hexadecimal color code `'#ffffff'`.

With these modifications, the "TETRIS" text at the top will be brown, and the start button will be a rounded button with a red color and white text.

Make sure to update the `MenuScene` import in the `game.js` file if necessary.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

Thank you! I changed the text color to #e35a3e and the button background to 0xde2b4e. I want to make the text stand out a bit more, possibly by adding something like a shadow, and create some contrast between it, the button color, and the background appearance. Could you also add hover and click effects to the button? Please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js. This is how it looks now:
![menuScene Iteration1](prompts_assets/menuSceneIteration1.png)

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's the updated `MenuScene.js` with the requested changes:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#e35a3e', // Updated text color
        stroke: '#000000', // Added stroke for text shadow effect
        strokeThickness: 4, // Adjusted stroke thickness for better visibility
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1); // Updated button color
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // Add hover effect
    startButton.on('pointerover', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xe56b6f, 1); // Darker color on hover
    });

    // Add click effect
    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xc62828, 1); // Even darker color on click
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });

    // Reset button color on pointer out
    startButton.on('pointerout', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1); // Reset to original color
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The color of the "TETRIS" text is updated to `'#e35a3e'` as requested.

2. To create a shadow effect and increase the contrast of the text, a stroke is added to the text using the `stroke` property. The stroke color is set to `'#000000'` (black), and the `strokeThickness` is adjusted to `4` for better visibility.

3. The button background color is updated to `0xde2b4e` as requested.

4. Hover and click effects are added to the start button:
   - On hover (`pointerover` event), the button color is changed to a darker shade (`0xe56b6f`) to provide visual feedback.
   - On click (`pointerdown` event), the button color is changed to an even darker shade (`0xc62828`) to indicate the button press. The `GameScene` is then started using `this.scene.start('GameScene')`.
   - When the pointer moves out of the button (`pointerout` event), the button color is reset to its original color (`0xde2b4e`).

These changes should enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the menu scene. The "TETRIS" text will have a shadow effect to make it stand out more, and the start button will have hover and click effects to provide better user feedback.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

It seems like the hover and click effects aren't working. I changed the strokeThickness to 6. I was wondering if we could change the font as well and possibly use something like italics to make it stand out even more. Could you please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js?

**Assistant:**

Apologies for the confusion. Let's update the `MenuScene.js` file with the requested changes and ensure that the hover and click effects are working correctly.

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
    this.load.fontFamily('Italic-Pixel-Font', 'fonts/Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf'); // Add this line to load the custom font
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        fontFamily: 'Italic-Pixel-Font', // Use the custom font
        fontSize: '128px',
        fill: '#e35a3e',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 6, // Increased stroke thickness
        fontStyle: 'italic', // Added italic font style
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1);
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        fontFamily: 'Italic-Pixel-Font', // Use the custom font
        fontSize: '48px',
        fill: '#ffffff',
        fontStyle: 'italic', // Added italic font style
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // Add hover effect
    startButton.on('pointerover', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xe56b6f, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
    });

    // Add click effect
    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xc62828, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });

    // Reset button color on pointer out
    startButton.on('pointerout', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The `strokeThickness` of the "TETRIS" text is increased to `6` as requested.

2. A custom font is loaded in the `preload` method using `this.load.fontFamily()`. Make sure to have the font file (e.g., `Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf`) in the `assets/fonts` directory.

3. The `fontFamily` property is set to `'Italic-Pixel-Font'` for both the "TETRIS" text and the "START" button text to use the custom font.

4. The `fontStyle` property is set to `'italic'` for both the "TETRIS" text and the "START" button text to make them italic.

5. The hover and click effects are updated to ensure they work correctly. Inside each event handler (`pointerover`, `pointerdown`, `pointerout`), the button graphics are cleared using `startButton.clear()` before redrawing the button with the updated color.

Please make sure to have the custom font file (e.g., `Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf`) in the `assets/fonts` directory for the font to load correctly.

With these changes, the "TETRIS" text should have a thicker stroke and an italic font style, making it stand out more. The start button should also have the custom italic font and working hover and click effects.

I am getting following error when I try to run the game:
```

```
I added my fonts as follows `assets/fonts/ThugLifeItalicTTF.ttf` and `assets/fonts/ThugLifeTTF.ttf`. Could you please help me fix this issue?

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `this.load.fontFamily` is not a built-in function in Phaser. To load custom fonts in Phaser, you need to use the `WebFontLoader` library. Let's update the code to use the `WebFontLoader` and fix the issue.

First, include the `WebFontLoader` library in your project by adding the following script tag in your `index.html` file, before the Phaser script:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js"></script>
```

Now, let's update the `MenuScene.js` file to use the `WebFontLoader` for loading the custom fonts:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
    
    // Load custom fonts using WebFontLoader
    WebFont.load({
      custom: {
        families: ['ThugLifeItalic', 'ThugLife'],
        urls: ['assets/fonts/fonts.css']
      },
      active: () => {
        this.create();
      }
    });
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        fontFamily: 'ThugLifeItalic',
        fontSize: '128px',
        fill: '#e35a3e',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 6,
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // ... rest of the create method code ...
  }
}
```

In the updated code:

1. We remove the `this.load.fontFamily` line from the `preload` method.

2. We use the `WebFont.load` function to load the custom fonts. Inside the `custom` property, we specify the font families (`'ThugLifeItalic'` and `'ThugLife'`) and the URL of the CSS file that defines the font faces (`'assets/fonts/fonts.css'`).

3. In the `active` callback of `WebFont.load`, we call `this.create()` to ensure that the fonts are loaded before creating the scene elements.

4. We update the `fontFamily` property of the "TETRIS" text to use the `'ThugLifeItalic'` font.

Next, create a CSS file named `fonts.css` in the `assets/fonts` directory with the following content:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ThugLifeItalic';
  src: url('ThugLifeItalicTTF.ttf') format('truetype');
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'ThugLife';
  src: url('ThugLifeTTF.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

This CSS file defines the font faces for the custom fonts, linking them to the respective font files.

With these changes, the custom fonts should load correctly, and the error should be resolved. The "TETRIS" text will use the `ThugLifeItalic` font, and you can use the `ThugLife` font for other elements as needed.
