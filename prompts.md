**User:**

I am working on building a version of Tetris with Phaser 3. I want the game to include:

1. A splash screen featuring the game's title.
2. A menu scene where the player can click a start button. This scene will display the text "TETRIS" and possibly include a background image.
3. A game scene, which will display a block at the top for "LINES - 000" just above the game board. The game board should have a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares. To the left of the board, there should be three stacked boxes. Starting from the bottom, the first box will display "LEVEL" along with the current level number. Above that, a "NEXT" box will show the next piece and its orientation. At the top, there is another box divided into four rows. The first two rows are for "TOP" and will display the top score. Below that, "SCORE" will display the current score, supporting up to six digits.

Let's outline the structure of the project and how to organize the code for the game. After that, we can begin building the game scene by scene using the Phaser 3 JavaScript library.

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's break down the project structure and organize the code for your Tetris game using Phaser 3. Here's a suggested project structure:

```
tetris-game/
│
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── background.png
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── fonts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── audio/
│       └── ...
│
├── src/
│   ├── scenes/
│   │   ├── SplashScene.js
│   │   ├── MenuScene.js
│   │   └── GameScene.js
│   ├── config.js
│   └── game.js
│
└── index.html
```

Here's a breakdown of the project structure:

- The `assets` folder contains all the game assets, such as images, fonts, and audio files.
- The `src` folder contains the JavaScript source code for the game.
  - The `scenes` folder contains separate files for each game scene (Splash, Menu, Game).
  - `config.js` holds the game configuration, such as screen dimensions and other settings.
  - `game.js` is the main entry point of the game where you create the Phaser game instance and add the scenes.
- `index.html` is the HTML file that loads the game.

Now, let's start building the game scene by scene:

1. Splash Scene:
   - Create a new file `SplashScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - In this scene, display the game's title and any necessary splash screen graphics.
   - After a certain duration or user interaction, transition to the Menu Scene.

2. Menu Scene:
   - Create a new file `MenuScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - Display the text "TETRIS" and optionally add a background image.
   - Add a start button that, when clicked, transitions to the Game Scene.

3. Game Scene:
   - Create a new file `GameScene.js` in the `scenes` folder.
   - Set up the game board with a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares.
   - Display the "LINES - 000" block at the top above the game board.
   - Create three stacked boxes to the left of the board:
     - Bottom box: Display "LEVEL" and the current level number.
     - Middle box: Display "NEXT" and show the next piece and its orientation.
     - Top box: Divide into four rows. The first two rows are for "TOP" and display the top score. The bottom two rows are for "SCORE" and display the current score (up to six digits).

To organize the code for each scene, you can use Phaser's scene lifecycle methods:

- `preload()`: Load assets required for the scene.
- `create()`: Set up the scene, create game objects, and initialize variables.
- `update()`: Update the scene every frame, handle game logic and input.

In the `game.js` file, create the Phaser game instance and add the scenes in the desired order.

```javascript
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';
import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene.js';
import GameScene from './scenes/GameScene.js';

const config = {
  // ... game configuration
  scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene, GameScene]
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

This outline should give you a good starting point for structuring your Tetris game using Phaser 3. You can now start implementing each scene and adding the necessary game logic and graphics.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to provide more detailed guidance on any specific part of the game!

**User:**

Thank you! This plan is very helpful. I've created the file structure and added empty files, including favicon32x32.png, favicon16x16.png, and the background image for the splash scene, splashSceneBackground.png (1024x1024). I want to continue by completing index.html and integrating the game to ensure this part is working and visible before proceeding with the implementation of the scenes.

**Assistant:**

Excellent! Let's proceed with completing the `index.html` file and integrating the game to ensure it's working and visible before diving into the implementation of the scenes.

Here's an example of how your `index.html` file could look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tetris Game</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/images/favicon32x32.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="assets/images/favicon16x16.png">
  <style>
    body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      background-color: #000;
    }
    canvas {
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="game-container"></div>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="src/game.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this `index.html` file:

- We set the document title to "Tetris Game".
- We add the favicon links for different sizes (32x32 and 16x16) in the `<head>` section.
- We include a simple CSS style to remove the default margin and padding from the `body`, set the background color to black, and center the game canvas horizontally.
- We create a `<div>` element with the id "game-container" where the game canvas will be inserted.
- We include the Phaser library from a CDN (you can also download and host it locally if preferred).
- Finally, we include the `game.js` file as a module using the `type="module"` attribute.

Now, let's update the `game.js` file to create the Phaser game instance and load the splash scene background:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';

const gameConfig = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: config.width,
  height: config.height,
  parent: 'game-container',
  scene: [SplashScene],
};

new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
```

In the `game.js` file:

- We import the `config` object from a separate `config.js` file (which we'll create next) to set the game's width and height.
- We import the `SplashScene` from the `SplashScene.js` file.
- We create a `gameConfig` object with the necessary configuration properties, including the game dimensions, the parent element (the "game-container" div), and the initial scene (SplashScene).
- Finally, we create a new instance of the Phaser game using the `gameConfig`.

Create a new file `config.js` in the `src` folder with the following content:

```javascript
// config.js
export default {
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  // ... other game configurations
};
```

This `config.js` file exports an object with the game's width and height. You can adjust these values according to your desired game dimensions.

With these files in place, you should now see the game canvas with the splash scene background image when you open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Next, we'll start implementing the `SplashScene` to display the game title and handle the transition to the `MenuScene`.

**User:**

Thank you! I applied all the changes. I also changed the CDN to point to phaser@v3.80.1 instead of phaser@3.55.2 because this is the newest version. I added the following link tag: `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="64x64" href="assets/images/favicon64x64.png">`. Let's continue with implementing the SplashScene and adding the assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png image. I am attaching the splashSceneBackground.png image to have ideas on how it looks.
![splashSceneBackground image](assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png)

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's implement the `SplashScene` and add the `splashSceneBackground.png` image to the game.

First, make sure the `splashSceneBackground.png` image is placed in the `assets/images` folder.

Now, open the `SplashScene.js` file in the `src/scenes` folder and add the following code:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('splashBackground', 'assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    this.add.image(0, 0, 'splashBackground').setOrigin(0);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    this.time.delayedCall(2000, () => {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the `SplashScene`:

- We define a constructor and call `super('SplashScene')` to set the scene key.

- In the `preload` method, we load the `splashSceneBackground.png` image using `this.load.image()` and assign it a key of `'splashBackground'`.

- In the `create` method:
  - We add the splash background image to the scene using `this.add.image()`, positioning it at (0, 0) and setting its origin to the top-left corner.
  - We add the "TETRIS" title text using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center of the screen using `this.cameras.main.centerX` and `this.cameras.main.centerY`. We set the font size to 128 pixels and the fill color to white.
  - We use `this.time.delayedCall()` to wait for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) before starting the `'MenuScene'` using `this.scene.start('MenuScene')`.

Make sure to import the `SplashScene` in the `game.js` file:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';

// ... rest of the game configuration and initialization code
```

With these changes, when you run the game, you should see the splash screen with the background image and the "TETRIS" title text. After 2 seconds, the game will automatically transition to the `MenuScene` (which we'll implement next).

The provided `splashSceneBackground.png` image looks great and fits well with the game's theme. The blue grid pattern and the "TETRIS" logo in the center create a visually appealing splash screen.

Next, let's move on to implementing the `MenuScene` where the player can click a start button to begin the game.

**User:**

The image already contains the text "TETRIS", so we don't need to add any extra text. Also, the screen size is 800x600, but the image is 1024x1024. We can resize it to fit better in the frame, as there is some extra space on the sides anyway. Could you upscale it to adjust appropriately? I also adjusted the `this.time.delayedCall` to be after 3s instead of 2s. What is the difference between using `this.time.delayedCall` and using the `update` method in combination with a check that the time is >3000, for example, to handle the transition to the `MenuScene`?

**Assistant:**

Apologies for the confusion. Since the splash background image already contains the "TETRIS" text, we don't need to add it separately. Let's update the `SplashScene` to resize the background image to fit the screen size of 800x600 and adjust the delay to 3 seconds.

Here's the updated `SplashScene.js` code:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('splashBackground', 'assets/images/splashSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'splashBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    this.time.delayedCall(3000, () => {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the updated code:

- We create the background image using `this.add.image()` and store it in the `backgroundImage` variable.
- We calculate the scale factors `scaleX` and `scaleY` by dividing the screen width and height by the background image's width and height, respectively.
- We set the scale of the background image using `backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY)` to make it fit the screen size.
- We adjust the delay to 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) in `this.time.delayedCall()`.

Regarding the difference between using `this.time.delayedCall()` and using the `update()` method with a time check:

- `this.time.delayedCall()` is a built-in Phaser method that allows you to execute a callback function after a specified delay. It is a convenient way to handle delayed actions without the need for manual time tracking. The delayed call is automatically managed by Phaser's time system.

- Using the `update()` method with a time check involves manually tracking the elapsed time and checking if it exceeds a certain threshold. You would need to store the start time and compare it with the current time in each frame update. This approach gives you more control over the timing logic but requires additional code to manage the time tracking.

Here's an example of how you could use the `update()` method with a time check:

```javascript
// SplashScene.js
export default class SplashScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('SplashScene');
    this.startTime = 0;
  }

  // ... preload() and create() methods ...

  update(time) {
    if (time - this.startTime > 3000) {
      this.scene.start('MenuScene');
    }
  }

  create() {
    // ... background image setup ...
    this.startTime = this.time.now;
  }
}
```

In this approach, we store the start time in the `startTime` property when the scene is created. In the `update()` method, we compare the current time (`time`) with the start time and check if the difference exceeds 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). If the condition is met, we start the `MenuScene`.

Both approaches achieve the same result, but using `this.time.delayedCall()` is generally more straightforward and recommended for simple delayed actions.

Let me know if you have any further questions!

**User:**

I decided to use this.time.delayedCall and I applied all the changes. Everything worked perfectly, thank you! Let's continue with implementing the menu page. I would like to have a large text block at the top with "TETRIS" and, more towards the center, a button labeled "START" which, when clicked, transitions the user to the GameScene. For the background, I have the assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png image that is 1024x1024. The main colors are different shades of dark gray and black.

**Assistant:**

Great! Let's implement the menu scene with the "TETRIS" text block at the top, a "START" button in the center, and the `menuSceneBackground.png` image as the background.

First, make sure the `menuSceneBackground.png` image is placed in the `assets/images` folder.

Now, create a new file called `MenuScene.js` in the `src/scenes` folder and add the following code:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.rectangle(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      200,
      80,
      0xffffff
    );
    startButton.setInteractive();

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#000000',
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });
  }
}
```

In the `MenuScene`:

- We load the `menuSceneBackground.png` image in the `preload()` method using `this.load.image()` and assign it a key of `'menuBackground'`.

- In the `create()` method:
  - We add the background image and scale it to fit the screen size, similar to how we did it in the `SplashScene`.
  - We add the "TETRIS" title text using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center horizontally and 150 pixels from the top. We set the font size to 128 pixels and the fill color to white.
  - We create a "START" button using `this.add.rectangle()`, positioning it at the center of the screen. We set its width to 200 pixels, height to 80 pixels, and fill color to white.
  - We make the button interactive using `startButton.setInteractive()`, allowing it to respond to input events.
  - We add the "START" text on top of the button using `this.add.text()`, positioning it at the center of the button. We set the font size to 48 pixels and the fill color to black.
  - We add a `pointerdown` event listener to the button using `startButton.on('pointerdown', ...)`. When the button is clicked, we start the `GameScene` using `this.scene.start('GameScene')`.

Make sure to import the `MenuScene` in the `game.js` file and add it to the scene array:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';
import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene.js';

const gameConfig = {
  // ... game configuration ...
  scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene],
};

new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
```

With these changes, after the splash screen, the game will transition to the menu scene, where you will see the "TETRIS" text block at the top and a "START" button in the center. Clicking the "START" button will start the `GameScene` (which we'll implement next).

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

Thank you! It works, but I would like to make a few changes to MenuScene.js:
1) I want the text at the top to be brown.
2) I want the start button to be a rounded button with a red color and the text to be white.
Please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js.

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's the updated `MenuScene.js` with the changes you requested:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#a52a2a', // Brown color
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xff0000, 1); // Red color
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff', // White color
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The color of the "TETRIS" text at the top is changed to brown. We use the hexadecimal color code `'#a52a2a'` to represent the brown color.

2. The start button is now created using `this.add.graphics()` instead of `this.add.rectangle()`. We set the fill color to red using `startButton.fillStyle(0xff0000, 1)`. The button is drawn as a rounded rectangle using `startButton.fillRoundedRect()`, with a width of 200 pixels, a height of 80 pixels, and a corner radius of 40 pixels. The button is positioned at the center of the screen.

   To make the rounded button interactive, we use `startButton.setInteractive()` and pass a `Phaser.Geom.Rectangle` object that defines the interactive area of the button. The rectangle is positioned at the same coordinates as the button and has the same dimensions.

   The text color of the "START" text on the button is changed to white using the hexadecimal color code `'#ffffff'`.

With these modifications, the "TETRIS" text at the top will be brown, and the start button will be a rounded button with a red color and white text.

Make sure to update the `MenuScene` import in the `game.js` file if necessary.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

Thank you! I changed the text color to #e35a3e and the button background to 0xde2b4e. I want to make the text stand out a bit more, possibly by adding something like a shadow, and create some contrast between it, the button color, and the background appearance. Could you also add hover and click effects to the button? Please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js. This is how it looks now:
![menuScene Iteration1](prompts_assets/menuSceneIteration1.png)

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's the updated `MenuScene.js` with the requested changes:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        font: '128px Arial',
        fill: '#e35a3e', // Updated text color
        stroke: '#000000', // Added stroke for text shadow effect
        strokeThickness: 4, // Adjusted stroke thickness for better visibility
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1); // Updated button color
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        font: '48px Arial',
        fill: '#ffffff',
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // Add hover effect
    startButton.on('pointerover', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xe56b6f, 1); // Darker color on hover
    });

    // Add click effect
    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xc62828, 1); // Even darker color on click
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });

    // Reset button color on pointer out
    startButton.on('pointerout', () => {
      startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1); // Reset to original color
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The color of the "TETRIS" text is updated to `'#e35a3e'` as requested.

2. To create a shadow effect and increase the contrast of the text, a stroke is added to the text using the `stroke` property. The stroke color is set to `'#000000'` (black), and the `strokeThickness` is adjusted to `4` for better visibility.

3. The button background color is updated to `0xde2b4e` as requested.

4. Hover and click effects are added to the start button:
   - On hover (`pointerover` event), the button color is changed to a darker shade (`0xe56b6f`) to provide visual feedback.
   - On click (`pointerdown` event), the button color is changed to an even darker shade (`0xc62828`) to indicate the button press. The `GameScene` is then started using `this.scene.start('GameScene')`.
   - When the pointer moves out of the button (`pointerout` event), the button color is reset to its original color (`0xde2b4e`).

These changes should enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the menu scene. The "TETRIS" text will have a shadow effect to make it stand out more, and the start button will have hover and click effects to provide better user feedback.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

It seems like the hover and click effects aren't working. I changed the strokeThickness to 6. I was wondering if we could change the font as well and possibly use something like italics to make it stand out even more. Could you please apply these changes and send me the updated MenuScene.js?

**Assistant:**

Apologies for the confusion. Let's update the `MenuScene.js` file with the requested changes and ensure that the hover and click effects are working correctly.

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
    this.load.fontFamily('Italic-Pixel-Font', 'fonts/Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf'); // Add this line to load the custom font
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        fontFamily: 'Italic-Pixel-Font', // Use the custom font
        fontSize: '128px',
        fill: '#e35a3e',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 6, // Increased stroke thickness
        fontStyle: 'italic', // Added italic font style
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    const startButton = this.add.graphics();
    startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1);
    startButton.fillRoundedRect(
      this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
      this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
      200,
      80,
      40
    );
    startButton.setInteractive(
      new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80
      ),
      Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains
    );

    const startButtonText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      this.cameras.main.centerY,
      'START',
      {
        fontFamily: 'Italic-Pixel-Font', // Use the custom font
        fontSize: '48px',
        fill: '#ffffff',
        fontStyle: 'italic', // Added italic font style
      }
    );
    startButtonText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // Add hover effect
    startButton.on('pointerover', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xe56b6f, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
    });

    // Add click effect
    startButton.on('pointerdown', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xc62828, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
      this.scene.start('GameScene');
    });

    // Reset button color on pointer out
    startButton.on('pointerout', () => {
      startButton.clear();
      startButton.fillStyle(0xde2b4e, 1);
      startButton.fillRoundedRect(
        this.cameras.main.centerX - 100,
        this.cameras.main.centerY - 40,
        200,
        80,
        40
      );
    });
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to `MenuScene.js`:

1. The `strokeThickness` of the "TETRIS" text is increased to `6` as requested.

2. A custom font is loaded in the `preload` method using `this.load.fontFamily()`. Make sure to have the font file (e.g., `Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf`) in the `assets/fonts` directory.

3. The `fontFamily` property is set to `'Italic-Pixel-Font'` for both the "TETRIS" text and the "START" button text to use the custom font.

4. The `fontStyle` property is set to `'italic'` for both the "TETRIS" text and the "START" button text to make them italic.

5. The hover and click effects are updated to ensure they work correctly. Inside each event handler (`pointerover`, `pointerdown`, `pointerout`), the button graphics are cleared using `startButton.clear()` before redrawing the button with the updated color.

Please make sure to have the custom font file (e.g., `Italic-Pixel-Font.ttf`) in the `assets/fonts` directory for the font to load correctly.

With these changes, the "TETRIS" text should have a thicker stroke and an italic font style, making it stand out more. The start button should also have the custom italic font and working hover and click effects.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

I am getting following error when I try to run the game:
```

    at e (phaser.min.js:1:141058)
```
I added my fonts as follows `assets/fonts/ThugLifeItalicTTF.ttf` and `assets/fonts/ThugLifeTTF.ttf`. Could you please help me fix this issue?

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `this.load.fontFamily` is not a built-in function in Phaser. To load custom fonts in Phaser, you need to use the `WebFontLoader` library. Let's update the code to use the `WebFontLoader` and fix the issue.

First, include the `WebFontLoader` library in your project by adding the following script tag in your `index.html` file, before the Phaser script:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js"></script>
```

Now, let's update the `MenuScene.js` file to use the `WebFontLoader` for loading the custom fonts:

```javascript
// MenuScene.js
export default class MenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('MenuScene');
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('menuBackground', 'assets/images/menuSceneBackground.png');
    
    // Load custom fonts using WebFontLoader
    WebFont.load({
      custom: {
        families: ['ThugLifeItalic', 'ThugLife'],
        urls: ['assets/fonts/fonts.css']
      },
      active: () => {
        this.create();
      }
    });
  }

  create() {
    const backgroundImage = this.add.image(0, 0, 'menuBackground').setOrigin(0);
    const scaleX = this.cameras.main.width / backgroundImage.width;
    const scaleY = this.cameras.main.height / backgroundImage.height;
    backgroundImage.setScale(scaleX, scaleY);

    const titleText = this.add.text(
      this.cameras.main.centerX,
      150,
      'TETRIS',
      {
        fontFamily: 'ThugLifeItalic',
        fontSize: '128px',
        fill: '#e35a3e',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 6,
      }
    );
    titleText.setOrigin(0.5);

    // ... rest of the create method code ...
  }
}
```

In the updated code:

1. We remove the `this.load.fontFamily` line from the `preload` method.

2. We use the `WebFont.load` function to load the custom fonts. Inside the `custom` property, we specify the font families (`'ThugLifeItalic'` and `'ThugLife'`) and the URL of the CSS file that defines the font faces (`'assets/fonts/fonts.css'`).

3. In the `active` callback of `WebFont.load`, we call `this.create()` to ensure that the fonts are loaded before creating the scene elements.

4. We update the `fontFamily` property of the "TETRIS" text to use the `'ThugLifeItalic'` font.

Next, create a CSS file named `fonts.css` in the `assets/fonts` directory with the following content:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ThugLifeItalic';
  src: url('ThugLifeItalicTTF.ttf') format('truetype');
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'ThugLife';
  src: url('ThugLifeTTF.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

This CSS file defines the font faces for the custom fonts, linking them to the respective font files.

With these changes, the custom fonts should load correctly, and the error should be resolved. The "TETRIS" text will use the `ThugLifeItalic` font, and you can use the `ThugLife` font for other elements as needed.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game scene!

**User:**

I moved the coordinates of the button and the rectangle to constants:
```javascript
const startButtonCenterX = this.cameras.main.centerX - 100;
const startButtonCenterY = this.cameras.main.centerY;
```
Additionally, I adjusted the size of the button text to be 46px instead of 48px. I am happy with the current result and would like to continue with GameScene.js.

I envision the screen to have the following elements:
1) At the top, there should be a block displaying "LINES - 000" to show how many lines have been completed so far. This part should not take up the entire screen but should match the width of the game board/scene.
2) Below the LINES block, the main game area should be present, with a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares. All the gameplay will occur here, where the user can move and rotate elements, and Tetris will be scored, among other activities.
3) To the right of the first two elements and at the same height, there should be a section consisting of three smaller blocks stacked on top of each other. The bottom block will display the current level with two labels: "LEVEL" and another label for updating the level number underneath. Above this, another block labeled "NEXT" will show the next element and its orientation. The top block should contain 4 rows: the first two labeled "TOP" with the highest score achieved so far, and the next two labeled "SCORE" with the current score displayed underneath.

Let's ensure this screen layout is visually accurate before starting to integrate the logic for moving pieces, checking scores, and managing the game state, etc.

**Assistant:**
Great! Let's create the layout for the `GameScene` based on your description. We'll focus on setting up the visual elements first and then move on to implementing the game logic later.

Here's the code for the `GameScene.js` file:

```javascript
// GameScene.js
export default class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('GameScene');
  }

  create() {
    const { width, height } = this.cameras.main;
    const boardWidth = 10;
    const boardHeight = 20;
    const blockSize = 30;
    const offsetX = (width - boardWidth * blockSize) / 2;
    const offsetY = 100;

    // Add background color
    this.add.rectangle(0, 0, width, height, 0x000000).setOrigin(0);

    // Create the lines label
    const linesLabel = this.add.text(offsetX, 50, 'LINES - 000', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });

    // Create the game board
    const gameBoard = this.add.grid(
      offsetX,
      offsetY,
      boardWidth * blockSize,
      boardHeight * blockSize,
      blockSize,
      blockSize,
      0x0000ff,
      0,
      0xffffff,
      1
    );

    // Create the side panel
    const panelX = offsetX + boardWidth * blockSize + 20;
    const panelY = offsetY;
    const panelWidth = 150;
    const panelHeight = boardHeight * blockSize;
    const panelBackground = this.add.rectangle(
      panelX,
      panelY,
      panelWidth,
      panelHeight,
      0x888888
    );

    // Create the level label
    const levelLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 20, 'LEVEL', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const levelValue = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 50, '1', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    // Create the next piece preview
    const nextLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 100, 'NEXT', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const nextPreview = this.add.rectangle(
      panelX,
      panelY + 150,
      panelWidth - 20,
      80,
      0x000000
    );

    // Create the score labels
    const topScoreLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 250, 'TOP', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const topScoreValue = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 280, '0000', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const scoreLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 320, 'SCORE', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const scoreValue = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 350, '0000', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
  }
}
```

In this code:

1. We create the "LINES - 000" label at the top of the screen using `this.add.text()`.

2. We create the game board using `this.add.grid()`, specifying the board dimensions, block size, and grid colors.

3. We create a side panel on the right side of the game board using `this.add.rectangle()`.

4. Inside the side panel, we create labels and placeholders for the level, next piece preview, top score, and current score using `this.add.text()` and `this.add.rectangle()`.

The layout should match your description, with the game board on the left, the side panel on the right, and the "LINES - 000" label at the top.

Make sure to import the `GameScene` in the `game.js` file and add it to the scene array:

```javascript
// game.js
import config from './config.js';
import SplashScene from './scenes/SplashScene.js';
import MenuScene from './scenes/MenuScene.js';
import GameScene from './scenes/GameScene.js';

const gameConfig = {
  // ... game configuration ...
  scene: [SplashScene, MenuScene, GameScene],
};

new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
```

With these changes, you should see the basic layout of the game scene when transitioning from the menu scene.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game logic!

**User:**

Thank you! The layouts has a few issues. 
Here again detailed requirements for the game scene:
Based on the provided image, here's a detailed description of the required layout for your game screen:

1. **LINES Counter**:
   - Positioned at the top-left, the "LINES" counter displays the text "LINES" followed by the number of lines completed. The number is right-aligned and padded with zeroes to maintain consistent formatting (e.g., "LINES-084").

2. **Game Board/Screen**:
   - Located directly below the "LINES" counter, the game board/screen should be a grid that accommodates gameplay with a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares. The grid is outlined and filled with the playing pieces.

3. **Score Indicators**:
   - To the right of the game board are the score indicators, with two separate sections:
     - The top section labeled "TOP" displays the highest score achieved so far.
     - Directly below, the section labeled "SCORE" shows the current score. Both scores are right-aligned and located within individual blocks for clear distinction.

4. **Next Piece Preview**:
   - Positioned in the center-right, adjacent to the game board, the "NEXT" block provides a preview of the next piece to come. This block is smaller than the game board and is enclosed with a border for emphasis.

5. **Level Indicator**:
   - Located at the bottom-right, aligned with the game board and the "NEXT" block, the "LEVEL" indicator displays the current level. The word "LEVEL" is at the top of the block, and the level number is prominently displayed below it.

6. **Design and Visual Elements**:
   - The layout has a cohesive design with a distinct border or framing pattern that envelops the game board and the informational blocks. It contributes to the visual identity of the game and separates different sections neatly.

7. **Text Style**:
   - All text elements, including "LINES," "TOP," "SCORE," and "LEVEL," as well as their associated numbers, use a consistent, clear font that stands out against the background. Text is white, which contrasts sharply with the dark background for easy readability.

8. **Color Palette**:
   - The color scheme is consistent throughout, with the background, borders, and blocks sharing a complementary palette that enhances the overall retro aesthetic of the game.

Igonre the background color for the moment. Could you please update the GameScene.js to match these requirements? I am also attaching the image of how the game scene should look like:
![gameScene](prompts_assets/NESTetris.png)

**Assistant:**

Thank you for the detailed requirements and the reference image. I'll update the `GameScene.js` code to match the layout you described. Here's the updated code:

```javascript
// GameScene.js
export default class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('GameScene');
  }

  create() {
    const { width, height } = this.cameras.main;
    const boardWidth = 10;
    const boardHeight = 20;
    const blockSize = 30;
    const offsetX = (width - boardWidth * blockSize) / 2 - 100;
    const offsetY = 100;

    // Add background color
    this.add.rectangle(0, 0, width, height, 0x000000).setOrigin(0);

    // Create the lines label
    const linesLabel = this.add.text(offsetX, offsetY - 50, 'LINES-', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });

    const linesValue = this.add.text(offsetX + 100, offsetY - 50, '000', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });

    // Create the game board
    const gameBoard = this.add.grid(
      offsetX,
      offsetY,
      boardWidth * blockSize,
      boardHeight * blockSize,
      blockSize,
      blockSize,
      0x0000ff,
      0,
      0xffffff,
      1
    );

    // Create the side panel
    const panelX = offsetX + boardWidth * blockSize + 20;
    const panelY = offsetY;
    const panelWidth = 150;
    const panelHeight = boardHeight * blockSize;

    // Create the top score labels
    const topScoreLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY, 'TOP', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });

    const topScoreValue = this.add.text(panelX + panelWidth - 10, panelY, '252160', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
      align: 'right',
    });

    // Create the current score labels
    const scoreLabel = this.add.text(panelX, panelY + 40, 'SCORE', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });

    const scoreValue = this.add.text(panelX + panelWidth - 10, panelY + 40, '165120', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
      align: 'right',
    });

    // Create the next piece preview
    const nextLabel = this.add.text(panelX + panelWidth / 2, panelY + 100, 'NEXT', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const nextPreview = this.add.rectangle(
      panelX + panelWidth / 2,
      panelY + 150,
      panelWidth - 20,
      80,
      0x000000
    ).setOrigin(0.5);

    // Create the level label
    const levelLabel = this.add.text(panelX + panelWidth / 2, panelY + panelHeight - 50, 'LEVEL', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);

    const levelValue = this.add.text(panelX + panelWidth / 2, panelY + panelHeight - 20, '15', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
  }
}
```

Here are the changes made to match the layout:

1. The "LINES" counter is positioned at the top-left, with the number right-aligned and padded with zeroes.
2. The game board is positioned below the "LINES" counter, with a width of 10 squares and a height of 20 squares.
3. The score indicators are positioned to the right of the game board. The "TOP" score is displayed above the "SCORE" with right-aligned values.
4. The "NEXT" piece preview is positioned in the center-right, adjacent to the game board.
5. The "LEVEL" indicator is positioned at the bottom-right, with the word "LEVEL" at the top and the level number prominently displayed below it.
6. The layout now has a more cohesive design with the game board and informational blocks positioned according to the reference image.
7. The text elements use a consistent font (ThugLife) and color (white) for readability against the dark background.
8. The background color is set to black for now. You can adjust it later to match your desired color scheme.

With these updates, the `GameScene.js` code should produce a layout that closely resembles the provided reference image.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game logic!

**User:**

There are a few things off:
1. The LINES element is not at the top of the board.
2. The TOP/SCORE and the NEXT box don't seem to be very aligned.
3. The LEVEL box is completely missing.

Try adding a surrounding orange box to each of these elements to make it easier to visualize what's going wrong and for us to align them correctly. I am attaching how the GameScene looks at the moment.
![gameScene Iteration1](prompts_assets/gameSceneIteration1.png)

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the inconsistencies in the layout. Let's address the issues you mentioned and add orange boxes around each element to help with alignment. Here's the updated `GameScene.js` code:

```javascript
// GameScene.js
export default class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('GameScene');
  }

  create() {
    const { width, height } = this.cameras.main;
    const boardWidth = 10;
    const boardHeight = 20;
    const blockSize = 30;
    const offsetX = (width - boardWidth * blockSize) / 2 - 100;
    const offsetY = 50;

    // Add background color

```

Here are the changes made:

1. The "LINES" element is now positioned at the top of the board, aligned with the game board. An orange box is added around it to visualize its position.

2. The "TOP"/"SCORE" and "NEXT" boxes are now properly aligned. Orange boxes are added around them to help with alignment.

3. The "LEVEL" box is added at the bottom-right, below the "NEXT" box. It is also surrounded by an orange box.

The orange boxes are created using `this.add.rectangle()` and positioned appropriately to wrap around each element.

With these updates, the layout should more closely match the reference image, and the orange boxes will help you visualize the alignment of each element.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to proceed with implementing the game logic!

**User:**

Thank you! Now I can see the LEVEL box. However, the new rectangular boxes and the actual TOP/SCORE and NEXT boxes seem off. The same goes for the LINES and the main game board.

Try to adjust them and perhaps think step by step about the basic approach to positioning all of them. Then, clearly communicate this strategy with me before making the changes and providing me with the final code. This way, I can check for any mistakes and review both the logic and the implementation. I am attaching images of the current look of the GameScene.

**Assistant:**

I understand your concerns about the alignment of the elements in the GameScene. Let's break down the positioning strategy step by step to ensure everything is properly aligned. Here's the approach we'll take:

1. Position the LINES box:
   - Align the LINES box with the top-left corner of the game board.
   - Adjust the width of the LINES box to match the width of the game board.
   - Center the "LINES-" text and the line count value vertically within the LINES box.

2. Position the game board:
   - Place the game board below the LINES box, with a small vertical gap between them.
   - Center the game board horizontally within the available space.

3. Position the TOP/SCORE box:
   - Align the TOP/SCORE box with the top-right corner of the game board.
   - Adjust the height of the TOP/SCORE box to accommodate both the "TOP" and "SCORE" labels and their respective values.
   - Right-align the score values within the TOP/SCORE box.

4. Position the NEXT box:
   - Place the NEXT box below the TOP/SCORE box, with a small vertical gap between them.
   - Align the NEXT box with the right edge of the TOP/SCORE box.
   - Center the "NEXT" label horizontally within the NEXT box.
   - Center the next piece preview horizontally and vertically within the NEXT box.

5. Position the LEVEL box:
   - Place the LEVEL box below the NEXT box, with a small vertical gap between them.
   - Align the LEVEL box with the right edge of the NEXT box.
   - Center the "LEVEL" label and level value horizontally within the LEVEL box.

By following this strategy, we can ensure that all the elements are properly aligned and positioned relative to each other. The LINES box will be aligned with the game board, the TOP/SCORE and NEXT boxes will be stacked on the right side of the game board, and the LEVEL box will be placed below the NEXT box.

Please let me know if this positioning strategy makes sense to you. If you agree with the approach, I'll proceed with updating the code to implement these changes. Once I provide the updated code, you can review both the logic and the implementation to ensure everything is correct.

**User:**

Yes go and implement it

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's the updated `GameScene.js` code with the positioning strategy implemented:

```javascript
// GameScene.js
export default class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super('GameScene');
  }

  create() {
    const { width, height } = this.cameras.main;
    const boardWidth = 10;
    const boardHeight = 20;
    const blockSize = 30;
    const gameWidth = boardWidth * blockSize;
    const gameHeight = boardHeight * blockSize;
    const offsetX = (width - gameWidth) / 2;
    const offsetY = 100;

    // Add background color
    this.add.rectangle(0, 0, width, height, 0x000000).setOrigin(0);

    // Create the lines box
    const linesBox = this.add.rectangle(offsetX, offsetY, gameWidth, 40, 0xff8c00);
    const linesLabel = this.add.text(offsetX + 10, offsetY + 10, 'LINES-', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });
    const linesValue = this.add.text(offsetX + gameWidth - 10, offsetY + 10, '000', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
      align: 'right',
    });

    // Create the game board
    const gameBoard = this.add.grid(
      offsetX,
      offsetY + 50,
      gameWidth,
      gameHeight,
      blockSize,
      blockSize,
      0x0000ff,
      0,
      0xffffff,
      1
    );

    // Create the top score and current score box
    const scoreBoxWidth = 150;
    const scoreBoxHeight = 100;
    const scoreBoxX = offsetX + gameWidth + 20;
    const scoreBoxY = offsetY;
    const scoreBox = this.add.rectangle(scoreBoxX, scoreBoxY, scoreBoxWidth, scoreBoxHeight, 0xff8c00);
    const topScoreLabel = this.add.text(scoreBoxX + 10, scoreBoxY + 10, 'TOP', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });
    const topScoreValue = this.add.text(scoreBoxX + scoreBoxWidth - 10, scoreBoxY + 10, '252160', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
      align: 'right',
    });
    const scoreLabel = this.add.text(scoreBoxX + 10, scoreBoxY + 50, 'SCORE', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    });
    const scoreValue = this.add.text(scoreBoxX + scoreBoxWidth - 10, scoreBoxY + 50, '165120', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
      align: 'right',
    });

    // Create the next box
    const nextBoxWidth = scoreBoxWidth;
    const nextBoxHeight = 120;
    const nextBoxX = scoreBoxX;
    const nextBoxY = scoreBoxY + scoreBoxHeight + 20;
    const nextBox = this.add.rectangle(nextBoxX, nextBoxY, nextBoxWidth, nextBoxHeight, 0xff8c00);
    const nextLabel = this.add.text(nextBoxX + nextBoxWidth / 2, nextBoxY + 20, 'NEXT', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
    const nextPreview = this.add.rectangle(
      nextBoxX + nextBoxWidth / 2,
      nextBoxY + nextBoxHeight / 2,
      nextBoxWidth - 20,
      nextBoxHeight - 40,
      0x000000
    ).setOrigin(0.5);

    // Create the level box
    const levelBoxWidth = scoreBoxWidth;
    const levelBoxHeight = 80;
    const levelBoxX = scoreBoxX;
    const levelBoxY = nextBoxY + nextBoxHeight + 20;
    const levelBox = this.add.rectangle(levelBoxX, levelBoxY, levelBoxWidth, levelBoxHeight, 0xff8c00);
    const levelLabel = this.add.text(levelBoxX + levelBoxWidth / 2, levelBoxY + 20, 'LEVEL', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '18px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
    const levelValue = this.add.text(levelBoxX + levelBoxWidth / 2, levelBoxY + 50, '15', {
      fontFamily: 'ThugLife',
      fontSize: '24px',
      fill: '#ffffff',
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
  }
}
```

In this updated code:

1. The LINES box is aligned with the top-left corner of the game board, and its width matches the width of the game board. The "LINES-" text and line count value are centered vertically within the LINES box.

2. The game board is positioned below the LINES box with a small vertical gap, and it is centered horizontally within the available space.

3. The TOP/SCORE box is aligned with the top-right corner of the game board, and its height accommodates both the "TOP" and "SCORE" labels and their respective values. The score values are right-aligned within the box.

4. The NEXT box is placed below the TOP/SCORE box with a small vertical gap and is aligned with the right edge of the TOP/SCORE box. The "NEXT" label is centered horizontally within the box, and the next piece preview is centered both horizontally and vertically.

5. The LEVEL box is placed below the NEXT box with a small vertical gap and is aligned with the right edge of the NEXT box. The "LEVEL" label and level value are centered horizontally within the box.

Please review the updated code and let me know if it meets your expectations. If you have any further suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know.
